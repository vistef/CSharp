//3. Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers with precision eps = 0.000001. Note that we cannot directly compare two 
//floating-point numbers a and b by a==b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal
//if they are more closely to each other than a fixed constant eps.
